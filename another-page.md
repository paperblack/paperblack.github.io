## Welcome to another page of my world

### I'll share some things as I learn, giving you a brief background of how I got into the puddle of learning what I do, as I do it.

### A list:
- Basics of Machine Learning
  - [The most important mathematical expression in ML/DL](./norms.html)
- Differential Privacy with TensorFlow
  - [What is Differential Privacy in Deep Learning?](./dp_dl.html)
  - [tf.nest.pack_sequence_as](./tf-flatten-pack_sequence.html)
  
### Paper Summaries:

- [Generative Models for Effective ML on Private Decentralized Datasets](./generative_models_private_decentralized_datasets.html)
