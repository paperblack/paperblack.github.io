# What is differential privacy?

Differential privacy is a formal framework to quantify to what extent individual privacy in a statistical database is preserved while releasing useful aggregate information about the database. It
provides strong privacy guarantees by requiring the indistinguishability of whether an individual is
in the database or not based on the released information, regardless of the side information on the
other aspects of the database the adversary may possess.
