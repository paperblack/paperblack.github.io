# What is bias and what is variance in simple terms?

The bias of an estimator is the difference between the expected value and true value. A model with a high bias tends to be oversimplified and results in underfitting. 
Variance represents the modelâ€™s sensitivity to the data and the noise. A model with high variance results in overfitting.
